### Integration of GitHub Users and Teams with Kubernetes RBAC

This documentation outlines the process of integrating GitHub user management with Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for efficient and secure access management.

#### **GitHub Configuration**

1. **User Setup:**
   - **Requirement:** All users requiring Kubernetes cluster access must have a GitHub account.
   - **Organization Membership:** Users should be a part of the designated GitHub organization or teams configured for cluster access.

2. **Admin Privileges:**
   - **Assignment of Administrative Rights:** Admin rights are assigned within GitHub organization or repository settings.
   - **Team Management:**
     - **Creation:** Formulate teams in GitHub for different user groups.
     - **Assignment:** Add users to these teams accordingly.
     - **Usage:** Utilize these GitHub team names in Kubernetes RBAC configurations to delineate their access levels.

#### **Kubernetes Configuration**

1. **RBAC Role Definition:**
   - **Access Management:** Kubernetes employs RBAC for managing access.
   - **Role Creation:** Establish roles for varied access levels (e.g., read-only for general users, cluster-admin for admins).

2. **Mapping GitHub Teams to Kubernetes Roles:**
   - **Role Binding:** In the role binding configurations, refer to the GitHub teams.
   - **Access Determination:** Upon GitHub user login, Kubernetes checks their team membership and grants access based on the roles aligned with their team.

3. **Example of a Kubernetes RoleBinding:**

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
   kind: RoleBinding
   metadata:
     name: team-admin-binding
     namespace: default
   subjects:
   - kind: Group
     name: github-team-name  # Replace with your GitHub team name
     apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
   roleRef:
     kind: ClusterRole
     name: cluster-admin  # For admin rights assignment
     apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
   ```

4. **Applying RBAC Configurations:**
   - **Configuration Storage:** Store role and role binding configurations in YAML files.
   - **Application of Configurations:** Utilize `kubectl apply -f [FILE_NAME].yaml` to apply these settings.

5. **User Access Management:**
   - **Authentication:** Users authenticate via GitHub for Kubernetes cluster access.
   - **Role-Based Access:** Access rights are contingent on roles linked to their GitHub team.
   - **Access Updates:** Modify user access by updating their GitHub team memberships. Kubernetes automatically reflects these changes based on the RBAC settings.

#### **Best Practices and Considerations**

- Regularly review and update GitHub team memberships to ensure proper access management.
- Define clear role descriptions in Kubernetes to align with the responsibilities and requirements of the GitHub teams.
- Regularly audit RBAC settings in Kubernetes to maintain security and operational efficiency.
- Consider implementing automation for syncing GitHub team changes with Kubernetes RBAC configurations.
